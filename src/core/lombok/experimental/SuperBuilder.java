/**
 * The SuperBuilder annotation creates a so-called 'builder' aspect to the class that is annotated with {@code @SuperBuilder}, but which works well when extending.
 * It is similar to {@code @Builder}, except it is only legal on types, is less configurable, but allows you to {@code extends} other builder-able classes.
 * <p>
 * All classes in the hierarchy must be annotated with {@code @SuperBuilder}.
 * <p>
 * Lombok generates 2 inner 'builder' classes, which extend the parent class' builder class (unless your class doesn't have an extends clause).
 * Lombok also generates a static method named {@code builder()}, and a protected constructor that takes 1 argument of the builderclass type.
 * <p>
 * The <code><strong>T</strong>Builder</code> class contains 1 method for each parameter of the annotated
 * constructor / method (each field, when annotating a class), which returns the builder itself.
 * The builder also has a <code>build()</code> method which returns a completed instance of the original type.
 * <p>
 * Complete documentation is found at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/SuperBuilder">the project lombok features page for &#64;SuperBuilder</a>.
